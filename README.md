# Wordpress Starter Theme - Stylus

Create an initial theme to start developing our theme for wordpress.

The starter template used methodologies work as SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) to modularize our project and BEM (Block, Element, Modifyer) to write a really beautiful and understandable css for anyone who fence to edit. We can also say that stylus is the cornerstone of our template and add extreme pills to increase his power, as in the case of rupture + jeet + nib and to finish all this work with wonderful Automator tasks called Gulp.
